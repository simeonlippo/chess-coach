## Content:
The images, signup form, icons, and hero image on the website were sourced from a variety of places. The hero image animation was inspired by the Love Running Project by Code Institute. The signup form was created using inspiration from Stack Overflow and the styling was influenced by advice obtained from Chat GPT. The remaining images and icons were sourced from Pixabay and Font Awesome.

# Unfixed Bugs:

                <hr>
                <p>In one experiment, researchers compared the recall ability of expert chess players to that of people with no chess-playing experience. They found that the chess players were significantly better at recalling lists of words they’d heard than people who had never played chess.</p>

                <h2>Elevates creativity</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Researchers at a school in India tested the creative thinking skills of two groups of students. One group was trained in chess playing, and the other was not.
                    The tests asked students to come up with alternate uses for common items and to interpret patterns and meaning in abstract forms. Students who played chess scored higher on tests. Researchers concluded that chess increased the students’ ability to exercise divergent and creative thinking.</p>
